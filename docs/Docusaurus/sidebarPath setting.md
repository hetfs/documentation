# sidebarPath setting in Docusaurus

The `sidebarPath` setting in Docusaurus is a crucial configuration option that defines the location of the sidebar configuration file for your documentation. This setting allows you to customize how your documentation is organized in the sidebar of your Docusaurus site. Here’s a detailed explanation of how it works:

### Overview of `sidebarPath`

- **Purpose**: The `sidebarPath` specifies the path to a JavaScript or JSON file that contains the structure of your sidebar. This file defines how the documentation sections, categories, and individual documents are organized and displayed in the sidebar navigation.

### How to Use `sidebarPath`

1. **File Location**:
   
   - The `sidebarPath` value should point to a file, typically named `sidebars.js`, `sidebars.json`, or similar, located in your project directory.
   
   - Example:
     
     ```javascript
     sidebarPath: './sidebars.js',
     ```

2. **Sidebar Structure**:
   
   - The referenced file should export an object or an array that describes the sidebar's structure.
   - You can create sections, categories, and specify which documents belong to each category.

3. **Example of `sidebars.js`**:
   
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
    someSidebar: {
      'Introduction': ['intro'], // Intro document
      'Tutorials': [
        {
          type: 'category',
          label: 'Getting Started',
          items: ['tutorial-basics/create-a-blog-post', 'tutorial-basics/create-a-document'],
        },
        {
          type: 'category',
          label: 'Advanced Tutorials',
          items: ['tutorial-advanced/advanced-usage'],
        },
      ],
    },
   };
   ```
   
   - In this example:
     - **`someSidebar`**: The name of the sidebar configuration.
     - **`Introduction`**: A section that links to an introductory document.
     - **`Tutorials`**: A category that contains two subcategories, each with its own items (documents).

### Sidebar Behavior

- **Rendering**: When you navigate to your documentation site, Docusaurus will read the `sidebarPath` setting, load the specified file, and render the sidebar based on the structure defined inside it.
- **Dynamic Updates**: If you add or modify documents in your documentation folder, you can easily update the sidebar by changing the `sidebars.js` file without needing to change the document files themselves.
- **Nested Categories**: You can create nested categories in the sidebar to organize your documents hierarchically, making it easier for users to navigate through complex documentation.

### Benefits of Using `sidebarPath`

- **Customization**: It provides flexibility in how your documentation is presented, allowing you to tailor the navigation to the needs of your users.
- **Clarity**: By structuring your sidebar clearly, users can find the information they need more quickly, improving the overall user experience.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeping sidebar configuration separate from document content allows for easier maintenance and cleaner organization.

### Conclusion

The `sidebarPath` setting in Docusaurus is a powerful feature that enables you to create a well-organized and user-friendly navigation structure for your documentation. By defining your sidebar in a dedicated configuration file, you gain the ability to customize how your documentation is presented, making it easier for users to explore and find the information they need.

==================

To create nested categories within your Docusaurus sidebar, you can structure your `sidebars.js` file to define categories and subcategories. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

### Step 1: Define Your Sidebar Structure

1. **Create or Open `sidebars.js`**: If you haven’t already, create a `sidebars.js` file in the root of your Docusaurus project, or open the existing one.

2. **Use the Category Type**: Within your sidebar configuration, use the `type: 'category'` to define categories and their nested items.

### Example of Nested Categories

Here’s an example structure that demonstrates how to create nested categories:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  someSidebar: {
    'Getting Started': [
      // Top-level category
      'intro', // Single document
      {
        type: 'category',
        label: 'Installation', // Category label
        items: [
          'installation/quickstart', // Document in the Installation category
          'installation/advanced', // Another document
        ],
      },
      {
        type: 'category',
        label: 'Usage', // Another top-level category
        items: [
          {
            type: 'category',
            label: 'Basic Usage', // Nested category
            items: [
              'usage/basic-commands', // Document in the nested category
              'usage/basic-tips',
            ],
          },
          {
            type: 'category',
            label: 'Advanced Usage', // Another nested category
            items: [
              'usage/advanced-features',
              'usage/performance-tuning',
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
    'API Reference': [
      {
        type: 'category',
        label: 'Endpoints',
        items: [
          'api/user-endpoints',
          'api/admin-endpoints',
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

### Step 2: Explanation of the Structure

- **Top-Level Categories**: Each main category (like **Getting Started** and **API Reference**) can directly contain documents or other categories.

- **Nested Categories**:
  
  - You can create nested categories by defining an object with `type: 'category'` and a `label`.
  - Inside this object, use the `items` array to list either documents or additional nested categories.

- **Document Links**: Each item in the `items` array can be a string representing the document path, or another category object.

### Step 3: Using the Sidebar

Once you’ve defined your sidebar structure, Docusaurus will automatically render it when you build and serve your site. Users will see a clear hierarchy in the sidebar, allowing them to expand and collapse categories for easier navigation.

### Conclusion

By structuring your `sidebars.js` file appropriately, you can create a well-organized sidebar with nested categories in Docusaurus. This enhances the user experience by making it easier to find related documentation within a logical hierarchy.

    'Getting Started': [
      // Top-level category
      'intro', // Single document
      {
        type: 'category',
        label: 'Installation', // Category label
        items: [
          'installation/quickstart', // Document in the Installation category
          'installation/advanced', // Another document
        ],
      },
      {
        type: 'category',
        label: 'Usage', // Another top-level category
        items: [
          {
            type: 'category',
            label: 'Basic Usage', // Nested category
            items: [
              'usage/basic-commands', // Document in the nested category
              'usage/basic-tips',
            ],
          },
          {
            type: 'category',
            label: 'Advanced Usage', // Another nested category
            items: [
              'usage/advanced-features',
              'usage/performance-tuning',
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
    'API Reference': [
      {
        type: 'category',
        label: 'Endpoints',
        items: [
          'api/user-endpoints',
          'api/admin-endpoints',
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

### Step 2: Explanation of the Structure

- **Top-Level Categories**: Each main category (like **Getting Started** and **API Reference**) can directly contain documents or other categories.

- **Nested Categories**:
  
  - You can create nested categories by defining an object with `type: 'category'` and a `label`.
  - Inside this object, use the `items` array to list either documents or additional nested categories.

- **Document Links**: Each item in the `items` array can be a string representing the document path, or another category object.

To add an icon to a sidebar category in Docusaurus, you need to use the `icon` property within the category definition in your `sidebars.js` file. Here’s how you can do it step by step:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Icon

1. **Choose an Icon**: You can use an SVG or a PNG icon. Make sure it is stored in your project's static assets, typically under the `static` directory.

2. **Path to Icon**: The path should be relative to the root of your Docusaurus project. For example, if your icon is stored as `static/img/my-icon.svg`, you would reference it as `/img/my-icon.svg`.

### Step 2: Modify Your `sidebars.js`

Here’s an example of how to add an icon to a sidebar category:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  someSidebar: {
    'Getting Started': [
      {
        type: 'category',
        label: 'Installation',
        icon: 'img/my-icon.svg', // Path to your icon
        items: [
          'installation/quickstart',
          'installation/advanced',
        ],
      },
      {
        type: 'category',
        label: 'Usage',
        icon: 'img/usage-icon.svg', // Another icon for a different category
        items: [
          'usage/basic-commands',
          'usage/basic-tips',
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

### Step 3: Explanation

- **`icon` Property**: The `icon` property is added to the category object. Here you specify the path to the icon image you want to display alongside the category label.

- **Rendering**: Docusaurus will render the icon next to the category label in the sidebar when you build and serve your site.

### Step 4: Verify Your Icon

1. **Build and Serve**: Run your Docusaurus site using the command:
   
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   
   or
   
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

2. **Check the Sidebar**: Navigate to your documentation site and check the sidebar to see if the icons appear next to the corresponding categories.

If your icon is in a subfolder within the `static` directory, you can still reference it in your `sidebars.js` file by providing the correct relative path. Here’s how to do it:

### Step 1: Organize Your Icon

1. **Store Your Icon**: Ensure your icon is placed in a subfolder within the `static` directory. For example:
   
   ```
   static/
    └── icons/
        └── my-icon.svg
   ```

### Step 2: Reference the Icon in `sidebars.js`

When referencing the icon in your `sidebars.js` file, include the subfolder in the path. For example:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  someSidebar: {
    'Getting Started': [
      {
        type: 'category',
        label: 'Installation',
        icon: 'img/icons/my-icon.svg', // Path to your icon in the subfolder
        items: [
          'installation/quickstart',
          'installation/advanced',
        ],
      },
      {
        type: 'category',
        label: 'Usage',
        icon: 'img/icons/usage-icon.svg', // Another icon in the same subfolder
        items: [
          'usage/basic-commands',
          'usage/basic-tips',
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

### Step 3: Explanation

- **Path Structure**: When you define the `icon` property, the path should start with `img/`, followed by the subfolder name (`icons/` in this case), and then the icon file name (`my-icon.svg`).

- **Rendering**: Docusaurus will correctly resolve the path and render the icon next to the category label in the sidebar.

### Step 4: Verify the Icon

1. **Build and Serve**: After updating your `sidebars.js`, run your Docusaurus site:
   
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   
   or
   
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

2. **Check the Sidebar**: Go to your documentation site and confirm that the icons appear correctly next to the categories.

If your icons are in a different directory than the `static` directory, you won't be able to reference them directly in the same way as you would for files located in `static`. Docusaurus serves files in the `static` directory directly under the root URL, so icons must be accessible from there.

### Options for Using Icons in a Different Directory

1. **Move Icons to the Static Directory**:
   
   - The simplest solution is to move your icons into the `static` directory or a subfolder within it (e.g., `static/icons/`).
   
   - After moving, you can reference them as follows:
     
     ```javascript
     icon: 'img/icons/my-icon.svg', // Example path after moving
     ```

2. **Use a URL**:
   
   - If your icons are hosted externally (e.g., on a CDN or another server), you can use the full URL to reference them. For example:
     
     ```javascript
     icon: 'https://example.com/path/to/my-icon.svg',
     ```

3. **Custom Webpack Configuration**:
   
   - If you have a specific need to keep your icons in a different directory within your project, you could set up a custom Webpack configuration. However, this is more complex and generally not recommended unless necessary.
   - You would need to configure Docusaurus to include the directory in the build process, which could involve creating a custom plugin.

### Recommended Approach

For ease of use and to avoid complications, the best practice is to store your icons in the `static` directory. Here's how you can do that:

1. **Organize Your Icons**:
   
   - Place your icons in `static/icons/`.

2. **Reference Them in `sidebars.js`**:
   
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
    someSidebar: {
      'Getting Started': [
        {
          type: 'category',
          label: 'Installation',
          icon: 'img/icons/my-icon.svg', // Path after moving to static
          items: [
            'installation/quickstart',
            'installation/advanced',
          ],
        },
      ],
    },
   };
   ```

### Conclusion

To use icons effectively in Docusaurus, it’s best to keep them in the `static` directory. If you need to use icons from a different location, consider moving them to `static` or using a URL for external icons. This ensures that your icons are served correctly and simplifies your configuration.

### Conclusion

By following this approach, you can easily use icons stored in subfolders within the `static` directory in your Docusaurus sidebar. Just ensure that the path you provide reflects the actual folder structure accurately.

By following these steps, you can easily add icons to your sidebar categories in Docusaurus, enhancing the visual appeal and usability of your documentation site. Make sure to use appropriate icons that represent the content of each category for better user experience.
