# Vale Command-Line Flags and Commands

Valeâ€™s command-line interface (CLI) is a **powerful and flexible tool** for enforcing consistent writing standards. Whether youâ€™re:

âœ… **Linting a single file**  
âœ… **Automating content checks in continuous integration (CI) pipelines**  
âœ… **Enforcing writing guidelines for a team**

Vale provides **commands** and **flags** that offer precise control over its behavior. This guide explains these features with **detailed descriptions**, **examples**, and **best practices** to help you maximize Valeâ€™s potential.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Understanding Command-Line Flags**

Flags modify how Vale operates, allowing you to customize its behavior. Below is an overview of commonly used flags.

---

### ðŸ“Œ `--config`: Specify a Custom Configuration File

ðŸ‘‰ **What it does**: Enables the use of a specific `.vale.ini` configuration file instead of the default.

ðŸ“Œ **When to use it**:

- If your project requires different Vale configurations.
- When overriding the default `.vale.ini`.

ðŸ”¹ **Example usage**:

```bash
vale --config="custom/path/.vale.ini" myfile.md
```

By default, Vale looks for `.vale.ini` in the **project directory**. If you work on projects with unique linting needs, this flag helps you specify the correct configuration.

---

### ðŸ“Œ `--ext`: Define a File Type for Piped Content

ðŸ‘‰ **What it does**: Sets the **file extension** when inputting content via `stdin`.

ðŸ“Œ **When to use it**:

- When **piping content** into Vale (e.g., using `cat` or `echo`).

ðŸ”¹ **Example usage**:

```bash
cat myfile.md | vale --ext=.md
```

Vale applies rules based on file types. This flag ensures proper rule application when processing piped content.

---

### ðŸ“Œ `--filter`: Run Specific Rules Only

ðŸ‘‰ **What it does**: Runs only rules that match a given **pattern**.

ðŸ“Œ **When to use it**:

- To **test or debug** a specific rule.
- When applying **only selected rules** instead of all available rules.

ðŸ”¹ **Example usage**:

```bash
vale --filter="Proselint.*" myfile.md
```

This example ensures that only **Proselint-related rules** run, making it useful for **targeted debugging**.

---

### ðŸ“Œ `--glob`: Lint Different File Types

ðŸ‘‰ **What it does**: Runs Vale on all files that match a specified **pattern**.

ðŸ“Œ **When to use it**:

- To check **varied file types** in a directory.

ðŸ”¹ **Example usage**:

```bash
vale --glob='*.{md,txt}'
```

This ensures that Vale **checks all Markdown (`.md`) and text (`.txt`) files** in the directory.

---

### ðŸ“Œ `--ignore-syntax`: Process Files as Plain Text

ðŸ‘‰ **What it does**: Ignores file **syntax parsing**, checking files line by line.

ðŸ“Œ **When to use it**:

- If Vale **doesnâ€™t support** a specific file format.
- When working with **plain text files**.

ðŸ”¹ **Example usage**:

```bash
vale --ignore-syntax myfile.txt
```

By default, Vale recognizes certain formats (like Markdown or HTML) and applies corresponding rules. This flag ensures that Vale treats the file as plain text.

---

### ðŸ“Œ `--minAlertLevel`: Filter Issues by Severity

ðŸ‘‰ **What it does**: Displays only issues of a specific **severity level** (`suggestion`, `warning`, or `error`).

ðŸ“Œ **When to use it**:

- To focus on **critical errors** while ignoring minor issues.

ðŸ”¹ **Example usage**:

```bash
vale --minAlertLevel=error myfile.md
```

This command filters out **suggestions** and **warnings**, showing only **errors** that require immediate attention.

---

### ðŸ“Œ `--output`: Customize Valeâ€™s Output Format

ðŸ‘‰ **What it does**: Adjusts Valeâ€™s output format for better **integration** with external tools.

ðŸ“Œ **Available options**:

- **`line`** (default)
- **`JSON`** (structured output for automation)
- **Custom templates**

ðŸ”¹ **Example usage**:

```bash
vale --output=JSON myfile.md
```

This ensures Vale outputs results in **JSON format**, making it easier to integrate with scripts and other tools.

---

### ðŸ“Œ `--no-exit`: Prevent Exit Codes from Stopping Execution

ðŸ‘‰ **What it does**: Prevents Vale from exiting with a non-zero code when linting errors are found. This is useful in scenarios where you want to continue execution even if issues are detected.

ðŸ“Œ **When to use it**:

- When running Vale in a script or CI pipeline where you donâ€™t want linting errors to halt the process.

ðŸ”¹ **Example usage**:

```bash
vale --no-exit myfile.md
```

This command ensures that Vale completes its run even if errors are found, returning a **0 exit code**.

---

### ðŸ“Œ `--version`: Display Valeâ€™s Version

ðŸ‘‰ **What it does**: Prints the installed version of Vale.

ðŸ“Œ **When to use it**:

- To verify the version of Vale youâ€™re using.
- When troubleshooting or reporting issues.

ðŸ”¹ **Example usage**:

```bash
vale --version
```

This command outputs the current version of Vale, which is helpful for compatibility checks and debugging.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Key Vale Commands**

Valeâ€™s commands go beyond simple linting and support configuration, debugging, and automation.

---

### ðŸ“Œ `ls-config`: Show the Active Vale Configuration

ðŸ‘‰ **What it does**: Displays the active Vale **configuration settings**.

ðŸ“Œ **When to use it**:

- To verify which **rules and styles** are active.

ðŸ”¹ **Example usage**:

```bash
vale ls-config
```

This command **prints the active configuration**, helping you debug incorrect settings.

---

### ðŸ“Œ `ls-metrics`: Analyze Text Complexity

ðŸ‘‰ **What it does**: Provides readability and complexity metrics for a given file.

ðŸ“Œ **When to use it**:

- To assess the **clarity and accessibility** of your writing.

ðŸ”¹ **Example usage**:

```bash
vale ls-metrics myfile.md
```

This command **analyzes** text length, readability scores, and complexity, helping you refine your content.

---

### ðŸ“Œ `sync`: Update Valeâ€™s Style Rules

ðŸ‘‰ **What it does**: Downloads and updates **external style guides** and configurations.

ðŸ“Œ **When to use it**:

- To keep the **latest versions** of custom styles.

ðŸ”¹ **Example usage**:

```bash
vale sync
```

This command updates custom or external Vale styles.

---

### ðŸ“Œ `ls-dirs`: Print Default Configuration Directories

ðŸ‘‰ **What it does**: Displays the locations of Valeâ€™s default configuration directories.

ðŸ“Œ **When to use it**:

- To identify where Vale stores its configuration files.
- When troubleshooting configuration issues.

ðŸ”¹ **Example usage**:

```bash
vale ls-dirs
```

This command outputs the paths to directories like `StylesPath` and `ConfigPath`, which are useful for debugging.

---

### ðŸ“Œ `ls-vars`: Inspect Current Environment Variables

ðŸ‘‰ **What it does**: Lists all environment variables that Vale recognizes and uses.

ðŸ“Œ **When to use it**:

- To verify if environment variables like `VALE_CONFIG_PATH` or `VALE_STYLES_PATH` are set correctly.
- When debugging configuration issues related to environment variables.

ðŸ”¹ **Example usage**:

```bash
vale ls-vars
```

This command prints the current environment variables and their values, helping you ensure proper configuration.
